# 35. Agent Progress Log

Date: 2026-06-14

This file is for Codex, Claude, and future agents. Do not move this content into `README.md`; the README is reserved for the Korean portfolio/project overview.

## How To Use

- Read this after `AGENTS.md`, the working rules, TODO board, and gap matrix.
- Keep entries short, evidence-based, and scoped to what was actually verified.
- Update this when folder organization, agent handoff context, or the current next-task sequence changes.
- Use `docs/qa/31_active_todo.md` for task status. Use this file for narrative handoff notes.

## Current Source Of Truth

| Area | Current Source |
| --- | --- |
| Active repo/worktree | `web-push-main/` |
| User-facing project overview | `README.md` |
| Agent rules | `AGENTS.md` |
| Live TODO | `docs/qa/31_active_todo.md` |
| Requirement gaps | `docs/qa/34_requirements_gap_matrix.md` |
| Verification evidence | local ignored `reports/` outputs plus summarized TODO notes |
| Repeatable scripts | `scripts/` |

## 2026-06-14 Folder/Docs Review

- Parent folder contains many legacy and experiment copies; current development must stay in `web-push-main/`.
- Root `AGENTS.md` points agents to `web-push-main/AGENTS.md`; do not treat root-level `block-editor.html`, `viewer.html`, `PLAN.md`, or `HANDOFF.md` as current truth.
- `README.md` in `web-push-main/` is a Korean portfolio-style overview. Keep it visual-first and do not add verification tables, agent-only status logs, or private sheet details there.
- Agent progress and handoff notes belong in this file plus `docs/qa/31_active_todo.md`.
- Real Roll20/user sheet fixtures and generated reports are local-only. Do not commit them to the public repo.
- Folder guide exists at the parent level as `폴더 안내.md`; update it only when actual top-level folder roles change.

## Local Evidence Snapshot

| Scope | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Browser L2 roundtrip | Local ignored `reports/roundtrip-browser/`; limited fixture scope only. |
| Mapping fidelity | Local ignored `reports/mapping-fidelity/`; selected private fixture scope only. |
| Edit flow smoke | Local ignored `reports/edit-flow-smoke/`; gallery drop and container nesting smoke. |
| Standalone preview cascade | Local ignored `reports/cascade-leak/`; standalone `buildSheetDoc` scope only. |
| Live preview/edit Shadow DOM cascade | Local ignored `reports/live-shadow-cascade/`; selected fixture scope only. |

## Next Development Sequence

1. Local preview/edit screenshot baseline for a selected ignored fixture.
2. Roll20 Room View Check: observe existing solo rooms only; no edits.
3. Roll20 Custom Sheet Upload Check: use Custom Sheet Sandbox first, or a new test room if sandbox is insufficient.
4. Asset loading parity: classify or cache external image resources that return 403 in browser fixtures.
5. Layer panel explicit before/after/inside drop zones.
6. Absolute positioning inside frames/groups with a clear UX mode.
7. Worker JS separate workspace plan and first source-preserving implementation slice.
8. Create a copyright-safe synthetic public example before re-enabling the sample loader.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Actual Verification Setup

- Added `docs/operations/37_roll20_actual_verification.md` as the source of truth for solo-room observation, sandbox/test-room upload checks, and local-only evidence.
- Chrome Roll20 reachability was checked at `https://app.roll20.net/campaigns/search`; the page was reachable in a logged-in state.
- No existing Roll20 room was inspected in detail, edited, or modified.
- Created `scripts/roll20_actual_compare_manifest.mjs` to generate ignored local report scaffolds under `reports/roll20-actual-compare/`.

## 2026-06-18 Edit Drag Responsiveness Slice

- Fixed an edit-canvas rollback risk: Shadow DOM remount cleanup no longer cancels the delayed Blockly/CSS commit timer.
- On drag end, `EditCanvas` now patches the emitted HTML cache immediately so the preview/edit render path sees the dropped position before the heavier model commit catches up.
- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` to cover existing-object mouse drag, not only gallery drop.
- Latest local ignored smoke report: `reports/edit-flow-smoke/edit-flow-smoke-results.json` PASS. The moved section's computed position and emitted CSS rule both reported `left: 464px; top: 256px`.
- Scope note: this proves synthetic edit-flow behavior in the static app only. Imported real-sheet object drag and actual Roll20 visual parity remain unproven.

## 2026-06-18 Preview/Edit Visual Smoke Setup

- Added `scripts/preview_edit_visual_smoke.mjs` for local imported-fixture preview/edit screenshot comparison.
- The script imports ignored fixtures through `window.__perfHook.importSheet`, captures only `#charsheet-root` for preview and edit, then computes a browser-canvas pixel diff over the shared crop.
- Latest local ignored report: `reports/preview-edit-visual/preview-edit-visual-results.md` PASS as a diagnostic pipeline with 0 console/page errors.
- Removed persistent edit-only drop/container outlines from the normal Shadow DOM render. Drop affordances now appear while widget drag is active, so edit mode is less visually polluted at rest.
- Added coarse mismatch bounds/quadrants and widened the browser capture viewport to 2200x1200 for fairer preview/edit screenshot comparison.
- Current mismatch diagnostics after the outline fix: AW2E 25.51% (bounds 0,10 850x1070), Les-Oublies 0%/10 px, YSHY 1BU 4.03% (bounds 0,223 850x857). These numbers are not a parity gate yet; they identify the next visual-difference work.
- Added `window.__perfHook.setPreviewZoom` so visual smoke scripts can force 100% zoom and avoid fit-to-width artifacts.

## 2026-06-18 Shadow Font Alignment Slice

- Fixed a major preview/edit visual divergence source: Shadow DOM edit render now registers Roll20 glyph font faces at document level, so dice/pictos pseudo-elements can resolve without leaking Roll20 selector rules into the app document.
- The Shadow mount also extracts only user CSS `@import` and `@font-face` declarations from the sheet CSS chunk for document-level font registration. User selector rules remain scoped inside the Shadow render.
- `scripts/preview_edit_visual_smoke.mjs` now records roll-button computed diagnostics and edit-toolbar occlusion metrics. The toolbar is hidden only while taking root screenshots, while the original overlap is still reported separately.
- Latest local ignored report after `lint` and `build`: `reports/preview-edit-visual/preview-edit-visual-results.md` PASS with 0 console/page errors. Diagnostic mismatch: AW2E 4.96% (bounds 0,404 850x676), Les-Oublies 0%/10 px, YSHY 1BU 1.26% (bounds 0,17 851x1063). Roll button counts match preview/edit for all 3 fixtures.
- Scope note: this proves improved local preview/edit alignment only. Actual Roll20 sandbox/room visual comparison remains unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Local Baseline Package Slice

- Added `scripts/roll20_actual_local_baseline.mjs` to prepare the local-only baseline required before Roll20 sandbox/test-room checks.
- The script imports ignored fixtures through the static app, captures local preview/edit screenshots, writes emitted `sheet.html`, `sheet.css`, `translation.json`, `sheet.json`, and creates `upload.zip` for Custom Sheet Sandbox/test-room use.
- Restored `data-testid="preview-iframe"` on `PreviewMain` so browser verification scripts can reliably target the iframe render path without visual UI changes.
- Latest local ignored report: `reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-local-baseline-smoke/local-baseline-results.md` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU. All 3 generated payloads had no blocking export warnings and matching preview/edit roll button counts.
- Scope note: this is the local baseline/payload preparation step only. It does not prove actual Roll20 visual parity until the payload is applied in Custom Sheet Sandbox or a new test room and compared.

## 2026-06-18 Rolltemplate Chat Smoke Slice

- Added `scripts/rolltemplate_chat_smoke.mjs` for local preview iframe -> ChatPane rolltemplate smoke.
- The script imports ignored fixtures through the static app, chooses a real roll button, clicks it, and verifies that a visible chat card appears.
- Latest local ignored report: `reports/rolltemplate-chat-smoke/rolltemplate-chat-smoke-results.md` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
- Follow-up hardening removed the visible app-only `rolltemplate:name` helper line, constrains rolltemplate chat cards to 280px, and clears simulated chat between fixtures so screenshots/results cannot accidentally reuse a prior fixture's card.
- Current smoke checks each fixture has exactly 1 resulting chat card, `Debug label=no`, and rolltemplate card width 280px.
- Click-mode evidence: AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY all use `user-click`.
- Les-Oublies was temporarily SKIP after the hidden-DOM click fallback was removed. Root cause was importer/emitter loss of `class="sheet-tabstoggle..."` on hidden inputs; preserving that class restored the Roll20 CSS default-tab selector and actionable roll buttons.
- Scope note: this proves the local app's roll button bridge, dice/rolltemplate parser path, and ChatPane render path for selected fixtures only. It does not prove actual Roll20 chat parity, worker parity, or all-sheet support.

## 2026-06-18 Hidden Input Class Preservation Slice

- Fixed `r20_hidden_input` import/export so hidden inputs preserve their `class` attribute as well as name, value, and style.
- This matters for Roll20 sheets that use hidden attribute controls as CSS state switches. Les-Oublies uses `.sheet-tabstoggle[value="combat"] ~ div.sheet-combat`; without the class, the emitted sheet kept the value but lost the selector anchor, leaving the default screen falsely empty.
- Latest local ignored validation after the fix:
  - `scripts/rolltemplate_chat_smoke.mjs`: AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU PASS with user-click, exactly 1 chat card, 280px card width, and no debug label.
  - `scripts/browser_roundtrip_smoke.mjs`: 3/3 PASS.
  - `scripts/preview_edit_visual_smoke.mjs`: PASS with AW2E 4.96%, Les-Oublies 4.76%, YSHY 1BU 1.26%.
- Scope note: this is local import/render/chat evidence only. Actual Roll20 sandbox/test-room visual and chat parity remain unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Actual Screenshot Diff Helper Slice

- Added `scripts/roll20_actual_screenshot_diff.mjs` so actual Roll20 screenshots can be compared against the local baseline run without committing private evidence.
- Expected local-only screenshot names are `roll20-sandbox.png`, `roll20-room.png`, and `roll20-chat.png` under each fixture's ignored `screenshots/` folder.
- Regenerated latest local baseline: `reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-actual-diff-ready/local-baseline-results.md` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
- Ran the new diff helper against that run. Result: all actual Roll20 targets are SKIP because no sandbox/room/chat screenshots have been captured yet. This is correct and must not be reported as Roll20 parity.
- Scope note: the comparison pipeline is ready for captured evidence; authenticated Roll20 solo-room observation and Custom Sheet Sandbox/test-room upload remain TODO.

## 2026-06-18 Imported Edit Sync Slice

- Added `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` for local static-app evidence that imported real-fixture nodes can move through the actual edit pointer path and sync back to preview plus emitted HTML/CSS position data.
- Fixed an imported edit desync source: `EditCanvas` now recognizes both raw design classes and Roll20-prefixed `sheet-r20-node-*` classes when deciding whether an optimistic drag move has been committed.
- Fixed a Shadow edit vs iframe preview layout difference caused by hotlink-sensitive sheet images: Shadow edit images now use `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`, matching iframe `srcdoc` behavior for the tested assets.
- Shadow edit no longer adds an extra outer `body.charsheet`; the real `#charsheet-root.charsheet` from `buildSheetParts()` carries layer state, making the selector shape closer to iframe preview.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`:
  - `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
  - `scripts/preview_edit_visual_smoke.mjs`: PASS, diagnostic mismatch AW2E 4.96%, Les-Oublies 4.76%, YSHY 1BU 1.25%.
  - `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs`: PASS.
- Scope note: this is local preview/edit sync evidence only. Actual Roll20 room/sandbox visual and chat parity remain unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Sandbox Reachability Slice

- Chrome Roll20 session was reachable and logged in.
- Created a new isolated Custom Sheet Sandbox for verification rather than modifying existing user sandboxes or real rooms.
- Launched the sandbox editor and confirmed the built-in `Sheet Sandbox Tools` dialog has separate file inputs for HTML, CSS, and Translation.
- Tried the first payload upload through the browser file chooser. Upload did not reach Roll20 because the Codex Chrome extension rejected local file access with `fileChooser.setFiles failed: Not allowed`.
- Local-only evidence is under ignored `reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-actual-diff-ready/roll20-sandbox-observation/`.
- Next action: enable `Allow access to file URLs` for the Codex Chrome extension, then retry payload upload in the kept sandbox editor tab and capture actual Roll20 screenshots.
- Scope note: this proves actual Roll20 sandbox reachability and upload UI discovery only. It does not prove Roll20 visual parity.

## 2026-06-18 Imported Edit Re-import Stability Slice

- Hardened `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` so the local imported edit smoke now checks the full edited emit -> re-import -> emit cycle after a real pointer drag.
- Candidate selection now prefers leaf-like editable nodes (`control`, `action`, `media`, `text`) over structural frame/flow/table containers, with penalties for nested block containers. This avoids false failures where the smoke repeatedly dragged large wrapper nodes that are visible but not the user's likely direct-edit target.
- Re-import CSS comparison is canonicalized for whitespace and the managed design-CSS marker while still recording raw CSS drift. Current raw drift is design CSS formatting around `r20-design-css:managed`; canonical selector/declaration content stays stable.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`: `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU. Each fixture moved an imported `input`, matched edit/preview coordinates, emitted absolute position data, and re-imported stably.
- Console 403 resource errors remain on AW2E/YSHY external asset loads; there were no page errors. This is still local static-app evidence only, not actual Roll20 parity.

## 2026-06-18 Asset Referrer and Resource Diagnostics Slice

- Added `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">` to the iframe preview document generated by `buildSheetDoc`.
- Added a Shadow edit document referrer policy helper in `mountSheetShadow()` so Shadow CSS/image requests use `no-referrer` as well as the existing per-`<img>` `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`.
- `scripts/preview_edit_visual_smoke.mjs` now records HTTP/resource failures by status, resource type, host, and example URL. Latest local ignored report PASS: AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU have 0 resource issues in the preview/edit screenshot path.
- `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` now records the same resource diagnostics. Latest local ignored report PASS for movement/re-import stability, but still classifies external image failures during edit/reimport: AW2E 10, Les-Oublies 5, YSHY 23. Top hosts are `i.imgur.com`, `imgur.com`, and `raw.githubusercontent.com`.
- Scope note: resource failures are now visible and separated from cascade/edit-sync failures. This does not prove actual Roll20 asset parity; next work is to compare with Roll20 sandbox/test-room behavior and decide whether local verification should cache or rewrite these external assets.

## 2026-06-18 Layer Drop Zone Slice

- Added explicit layer-panel drag zones: row top = `before`, row middle = `inside` when the target can receive children, row bottom = `after`.
- Added `moveBlockAfter()` to the Blockly adapter for top-level layer ordering. `inside` still routes through `nestBlockInContainer()`.
- Layer rows now expose `data-testid="edit-layer-row"` and `data-r20-layer-drop-mode` while a layer drag is hovering, so browser smoke can verify the user's intended insertion mode instead of inferring it.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`: `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS. The smoke still covers background absolute drop, container flow nesting, existing-object drag, and now verifies frame-row hover modes `before,inside,after`.
- Scope note: this is the first layer-panel insertion slice. Nested sibling before/after reordering inside Blockly statement chains and canvas-side insertion indicators remain TODO.

## 2026-06-18 Nested Layer Reorder Slice

- Extended `moveBlockBefore()` and `moveBlockAfter()` so leaf children inside a Blockly statement chain can be reordered around sibling blocks. Top-level ordering behavior remains available as the fallback path.
- The implementation intentionally rejects moving a block that has a connected `nextConnection`; moving whole subtrees/stacks needs a separate safer UX and test slice.
- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs`: after nesting two text inputs into a section, it uses the layer-row `before` drop path to move the second emitted input before the first and verifies the emitted HTML order changed.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`: `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS with 0 console/page errors.
- Scope note: this proves layer-panel sibling reorder for leaf flow children in the synthetic edit smoke. Imported-sheet layer reordering and canvas insertion indicators remain TODO.

## 2026-06-18 Canvas Drop Indicator Slice

- Canvas widget dragover now records the active container on the Shadow host with `data-r20-drop-target` and `data-r20-drop-mode="inside"`.
- The active target element also receives `data-r20-drop-mode="inside"` alongside `.r20-drop-target`; the Shadow CSS adds an inset highlight for the active inside drop.
- `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` now captures `c2-drop-indicator.png` and verifies the dragover state before dropping: host dragging flag is set, host mode is `inside`, active target id matches the section, and active target mode is `inside`.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`: `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS with 0 console/page errors.
- Scope note: this proves canvas container-inside insertion feedback for friendly widget drag. Canvas before/after sibling insertion lines remain TODO.

## 2026-06-18 Canvas Sibling Insertion Slice

- Canvas widget dragover now distinguishes `inside` containers from leaf sibling targets. For non-container targets, the upper half is `before` and the lower half is `after`.
- Shadow edit affordance CSS now draws insertion lines for canvas `before` and `after` modes instead of only the green inside-container outline.
- `appendFriendlyWidgetPreset()` can create a new flow widget before or after a sibling via the Blockly adapter, stripping absolute positioning when the move succeeds.
- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs`: after two text inputs are nested into a section, it verifies canvas `before` and `after` indicators on a nested input, drops a new text input on the `before` zone, and confirms the new block appears before the target in emitted HTML.
- Latest local ignored validation: `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS with 0 console/page errors; `canvasSiblingInsert.beforeIndicator.hostDropMode=before`, `afterIndicator.hostDropMode=after`, and emitted HTML index for the new input is before the target input.
- Scope note: this proves synthetic canvas sibling insertion for a leaf input target. Imported-sheet coverage, non-leaf subtree moves, and a separate committed `after` insertion test remain TODO/VERIFY.

## 2026-06-18 Canvas After Insertion Fix Slice

- Strengthened `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` so canvas sibling insertion now commits both directions: one new input before the target and one new input after the same target.
- The stronger smoke exposed a real adapter bug: nested `moveBlockAfter()` failed when the target already had a next sibling because it treated the occupied target next-connection as a hard failure.
- Fixed `moveNestedBlockAfter()` to splice safely: disconnect `target -> oldNext`, connect `target -> moving`, then connect `moving -> oldNext`.
- Latest local ignored validation after the fix: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, and `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS. Evidence includes `afterNewId` present and `afterNewIndexAfterEmit` greater than `targetIndexAfterAfterDrop`.
- Scope note: this proves synthetic leaf sibling after-insertion in the browser path. Imported-sheet layer reorder coverage and non-leaf subtree movement remain TODO/VERIFY.

## 2026-06-18 Imported Canvas Flow Insert Slice

- Expanded `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` beyond imported drag sync: it now also tests friendly widget insertion into imported sheet geometry and records imported layer leaf reorder when a safe adjacent pair exists.
- Added `canNestInContainer()` to the Blockly adapter and wired edit Shadow role attributes/canvas drop target selection to the actual statement-slot check. This fixes misleading drop affordances where a node looked like a frame/flow container but could not actually accept child blocks.
- Added `window.__perfHook.getBlockGraph()` for local-only verification so smoke scripts can distinguish real Blockly chain relationships from DOM nodes that merely look like siblings.
- Important test adjustment: imported canvas insertion waits past the `lastClearedAt` creation guard and only drops after a dragover indicator exists, preventing false background absolute drops in dense imported layouts.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`:
  - `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs`: PASS.
  - `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
- Evidence: all 3 fixtures passed imported visible-node move sync, imported canvas insertion as non-absolute flow content, and edited emit -> re-import stability. Les-Oublies also passed imported layer leaf reorder; AW2E/YSHY recorded SKIP for that sub-check because no safe imported leaf sibling pair was found.
- Scope note: this is still local static-app evidence. Actual Roll20 sandbox/room parity, non-leaf subtree movement, and broader corpus coverage remain TODO/VERIFY.

## 2026-06-18 Non-Leaf Layer Reorder Slice

- Extended nested layer reordering so moving a block with a connected `nextConnection` uses Blockly stack healing first, then inserts only the selected block and its input/statement descendants at the requested before/after target.
- Added a guard against dropping a block relative to one of its own input/statement descendants, which would create an invalid cycle.
- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` with a copyright-safe synthetic import: `outer > group-a/input-a + group-b/input-b`. The smoke moves non-leaf `group-a` after `group-b` through the real layer-row drop path, then verifies emitted order changed and both child inputs stayed inside their original groups.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS, and `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` PASS for the 3 prepared ignored fixtures.
- Scope note: this proves synthetic non-leaf group movement and keeps imported fixture edit-sync green. Imported real-sheet non-leaf layer reorder coverage remains VERIFY/TODO; actual Roll20 visual parity remains unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Absolute-Inside-Frame Smoke Slice

- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` with a copyright-safe synthetic frame/input import to lock down the "absolute positioning inside a frame" behavior requested for Figma-like editing.
- The smoke drags a child input inside its parent frame through the real pointer path. It verifies the parent frame gets a managed design CSS rule with `position: relative`, the child gets a managed design CSS rule with `position: absolute; left/top`, and emitted left/top matches the Shadow edit computed left/top.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, and `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS.
- Scope note: this proves the synthetic edit path. It does not yet prove imported real-sheet absolute-inside-frame behavior or provide a user-facing mode selector for choosing flow vs absolute placement inside a frame.

## 2026-06-18 Free Placement Mode Slice

- Added a user-facing edit placement mode control with `흐름` and `자유` choices. `흐름` keeps gallery drops as flow/nesting operations; `자유` lets a drop inside a capable frame become a nested absolute child.
- `appendFriendlyWidgetPreset()` now accepts `absolute-in-container`, nests the new widget into the target frame, writes child `position:absolute; left/top`, and adds a parent `position:relative` fallback when needed.
- Expanded `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` with a copyright-safe synthetic free-placement import. The smoke clicks `자유`, drops a gallery text input into a frame, and verifies the emitted HTML nests the input inside the frame with matching computed/emitted absolute coordinates.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, and `scripts/edit_flow_browser_smoke.mjs` PASS.
- Scope note: this proves the user-facing synthetic free-placement path only. Imported real-sheet frame placement, UX screenshots, and actual Roll20 visual parity remain unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Imported Free Placement Smoke Slice

- Expanded `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` so imported real-fixture edit sync now covers both placement modes:
  flow mode drops a friendly widget into an imported frame/flow target as non-absolute content, and free mode drops a second widget into an imported frame/flow target as nested absolute content.
- The free-placement smoke clicks the real `free` placement control, sends real `dragover`/`drop` events, and verifies parent/child structure plus computed/emitted positioning.
- Latest local ignored validation: `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` PASS for the 3 prepared ignored fixtures. Free insert evidence is stored only in the ignored report; all checked fixtures had parent `relative`, input `absolute`, and matching emitted/computed coordinates.
- Scope note: this is still local static-app evidence. It strengthens imported-sheet edit UX coverage, but actual Roll20 sandbox/test-room visual parity and chat parity remain unverified.

## 2026-06-18 Worker Workspace Split Slice

- Added a fourth Blockly workspace key, `worker`, so sheet worker JS no longer has to remain in the visual HTML workspace after import.
- Import paths now move imported top-level sheet worker blocks from `html` to `worker`; final emit merges the worker body back into `sheet.html` as a single `<script type="text/worker">`.
- Autosave/restore, code tabs, status/counts, and `window.__perfHook` now include the worker workspace.
- Added `scripts/worker_workspace_smoke.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run smoke:worker`.
- Latest validation: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, `corepack pnpm run smoke:worker` PASS, and `scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs` PASS for the 3 prepared ignored fixtures.
- Scope note: this is a source-preserving workspace split and local static-app smoke. It is not a claim that worker JS block coding is complete or that actual Roll20 worker behavior is parity-verified.

## 2026-06-18 Worker Roundtrip Guard Slice

- Strengthened `scripts/browser_roundtrip_smoke.mjs` so L2 browser roundtrip now checks `worker` raw body equality, worker block-count stability, worker body length, and emitted worker script count in addition to HTML/CSS/i18n stability.
- Latest local ignored validation: `node scripts/browser_roundtrip_smoke.mjs --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --report-dir reports/roundtrip-browser` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
- Scope note: this catches worker split drift in the local app bundle, but still does not prove actual Roll20 worker runtime parity.

## 2026-06-18 Worker Source Preservation Audit/Fix Slice

- Added `scripts/worker_source_audit.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run audit:worker`.
- Fixed worker extraction for nested/raw `<script type="text/worker">` cases. Import now rebuilds the worker workspace directly from source worker script bodies, strips those scripts from visual HTML blocks, and final emit appends one Roll20 worker script so worker code is not displayed on the sheet canvas or duplicated on re-import.
- Important scope: the emitted Roll20 sheet may canonicalize multiple source worker scripts into one final `<script type="text/worker">`; block counts are diagnostics, while exact worker source-body preservation is the gate for this slice.
- Latest local ignored validation:
  - `corepack pnpm run audit:worker -- --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --fixtures test-fixtures/visual --report-dir reports/worker-source-audit`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU with exact worker bodies.
  - `node scripts/browser_roundtrip_smoke.mjs --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --report-dir reports/roundtrip-browser`: PASS for the same 3 fixtures.
  - `corepack pnpm run smoke:worker -- --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --report-dir reports/worker-workspace-smoke`: PASS.
  - `node scripts/imported_edit_sync_smoke.mjs --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --report-dir reports/imported-edit-sync`: PASS.
- Scope note: this is local import/export preservation evidence. It does not prove actual Roll20 sandbox/test-room worker runtime parity or JS block-coding UX completeness.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Payload Hygiene Slice

- Added `lib/export/payload.ts` as the final Roll20 export boundary cleanup. Preview/edit still keep `data-r20-block-id` for selection and drag sync, but zip export strips those internal IDs from `sheet.html`.
- Export now converts internal `<!-- i18n[lang] "key": "value" -->` comment output into valid Roll20 `translation.json` object payloads. This fixed a real pre-upload defect caught by the new audit: AW2E and YSHY were previously writing non-JSON translation files.
- Added `scripts/roll20_payload_audit.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run audit:payload`.
- Updated `scripts/roll20_actual_local_baseline.mjs` so generated Sandbox payload files and `upload.zip` use the same internal-id stripping and translation normalization.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`:
  - `node scripts/roll20_actual_local_baseline.mjs --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --fixtures test-fixtures/visual --report-dir reports/roll20-actual-compare --run-label 2026-06-18-payload-clean-v2`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
  - `corepack pnpm run audit:payload -- reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-payload-clean-v2`: PASS for the same 3 fixtures with 0 issues.
- Scope note: this proves local upload payload hygiene only. Actual Roll20 sandbox/test-room upload and screenshot/chat parity remain unverified until Chrome file upload access is enabled.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Payload Roundtrip Visual Slice

- Added `scripts/roll20_payload_roundtrip_visual_smoke.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run smoke:payload-roundtrip`.
- The smoke re-imports the exact cleaned Roll20 payload files from `reports/roll20-actual-compare/<run>/local-baseline/<fixture>/payload/`, captures a preview screenshot, and compares it against the local baseline preview screenshot.
- The first strict top-left diff flagged AW2E and YSHY due to tiny screenshot alignment/width differences, so the helper now records a small-offset crop-normalized best match. This keeps the check useful for real payload drift without failing on a one-pixel capture offset.
- The first post-build smoke still failed AW2E after offset normalization. Root cause was CSS pseudo-class loss: imported selectors such as `.sheet-lock:not(:checked)` were emitted as `.lock:hover(:checked)` because the CSS pseudo block dropdown did not allow `not`. Expanded the pseudo-class allowlist to include common Roll20/official-sheet selectors (`not`, child/type position pseudos, validity/state pseudos).
- Latest local ignored validation:
  - `node scripts/roll20_actual_local_baseline.mjs --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --fixtures test-fixtures/visual --report-dir reports/roll20-actual-compare --run-label 2026-06-18-pseudo-fix-v1`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
  - `corepack pnpm run audit:payload -- reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-pseudo-fix-v1`: PASS for all 3 fixtures with 0 issues.
  - `corepack pnpm run smoke:payload-roundtrip -- reports/roll20-actual-compare/2026-06-18-pseudo-fix-v1 --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor`: PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU with 0% cleaned-payload preview mismatch and no visible script/rolltemplate runtime nodes.
- Scope note: this proves cleaned upload payloads still roundtrip visually inside the local static app. It still does not prove actual Roll20 sandbox/test-room visual parity.

## 2026-06-18 Legacy Export Audit Slice

- Added `scripts/roll20_legacy_export_audit.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run audit:legacy-export`.
- The audit uses only synthetic CSS. It checks that modern CSS keeps modern declarations in the source, legacy export CSS rewrites/removes legacy-risk declarations through `sanitizeForRoll20Legacy`, warnings are emitted, and `ExportDialog` gates sanitizer routing plus `sanitize-warnings.json` behind legacy mode.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run lint` PASS, `corepack pnpm run build` PASS, and `corepack pnpm run audit:legacy-export -- --report-dir reports/legacy-export-audit` PASS with 10 sanitizer warnings from the synthetic fixture.
- Scope note: this is an export-path sanitizer/routing gate. It does not prove preview-level legacy visual differences or actual Roll20 legacy sandbox/test-room parity.

## 2026-06-18 Roll20 Sandbox Upload Recheck + Legacy Preview Toggle Slice

- Rechecked the existing Chrome Roll20 verification tab. The Custom Sheet Sandbox dialog is open and exposes visible HTML/CSS/Translation upload labels backed by `#sheetHtml`, `#sheetCss`, and `#sheetTranslation`.
- A visible HTML label upload attempt for the YSHY local payload still failed at `fileChooser.setFiles` with `Not allowed`. This confirms the remaining actual Roll20 upload blocker is Chrome extension file URL access, not a missing sandbox control.
- Added `legacyCssSanitize` to the preview store and wired it through both local render paths: `buildSheetDoc` for iframe preview and `buildSheetParts` for Shadow/edit preview.
- Added the toolbar `구버전 CSS` toggle (`data-testid="preview-legacy-css-toggle"`) so users can compare modern/original CSS preview against legacy Roll20 CSS sanitize locally before export.
- Added `scripts/roll20_legacy_preview_smoke.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run smoke:legacy-preview`.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run smoke:legacy-preview -- --report-dir reports/legacy-preview-smoke` PASS. It proves iframe and Shadow/edit user CSS chunks both preserve modern CSS when OFF and route through `sanitizeForRoll20Legacy` when ON.
- Scope note: this is local preview/edit option plumbing and synthetic CSS proof. It does not prove actual Roll20 legacy visual parity; that still needs Sandbox/test-room upload and screenshots after Chrome file upload is enabled.

## 2026-06-18 Imported Legacy Fixture Visual Smoke Slice

- Added `window.__perfHook.setLegacyCssSanitize()` so browser verification scripts can toggle preview legacy mode without relying on localized toolbar text.
- Added `scripts/roll20_legacy_fixture_visual_smoke.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run smoke:legacy-fixture-visual`.
- The smoke imports ignored fixtures through the static app, captures preview iframe screenshots with legacy CSS sanitize OFF and ON, reads the final `#r20-user` CSS chunk, and checks that legacy-risk declarations are reduced when present.
- Latest local ignored validation after `lint` and `build`: `corepack pnpm run smoke:legacy-fixture-visual -- --out-dir ./out --base-path /roll20-block-editor --fixtures test-fixtures/visual --report-dir reports/legacy-fixture-visual` PASS for AW2E, Les-Oublies, and YSHY 1BU.
- Fixture result summary: Les-Oublies reduced legacy-risk CSS `1 -> 0`; AW2E and YSHY 1BU were classified `no-risk-css`. All three had 0 console errors, 0 page errors, 0 resource issues, no visible script/rolltemplate runtime nodes, and 0% modern-vs-legacy screenshot mismatch for the tested preview state.
- Scope note: this proves local imported-fixture preview toggle behavior only. Actual Roll20 legacy sandbox/test-room parity remains unverified until the Sandbox upload blocker is resolved and actual screenshots are captured.

## 2026-06-18 Automated Reference Diff Runner Slice

- Rechecked the kept Roll20 Custom Sheet Sandbox tab. File inputs still exist as `#sheetHtml`, `#sheetCss`, and `#sheetTranslation`; a hidden input click timed out, and a visible-label upload retry did not complete through the Chrome automation channel. Do not claim actual Roll20 upload/parity from this.
- Improved `scripts/make_visual_diff_pages.mjs`: generated diff pages now embed local reference/capture images as data URLs to avoid canvas taint, and compare native plus scaled reference candidates with 2D capture-crop search.
- Added `scripts/run_visual_fixture_diff_pages.mjs` and package alias `corepack pnpm run diff:visual-fixtures` so visual reference diff pages are executed in headless Chromium and summarized automatically.
- Latest local ignored validation: `corepack pnpm run diff:visual-fixtures` PASS. It generated 2 diff pages and collected JSON/Markdown with 0 console/page errors. Best diagnostics: AW2E 18.33% mismatch at crop `0,200,838,761`; Les-Oublies 13.51% at crop `10,544,824,799`.
- Scope note: this strengthens local reference-image diagnostics and crop normalization, but it is still not a Roll20 visual parity gate. Remaining mismatch needs classification by default state, viewport/reference crop, assets, wrapper/context, and CSS.

## 2026-06-18 Reference Diff Classification Slice

- Extended the generated visual diff JSON with mismatch bounds, quadrant counts, edge/center bands, dominant area, and crop-improvement ratio.
- Updated the headless runner Markdown to include a heuristic classification column. Latest PASS still reports AW2E 18.33% and Les-Oublies 13.51% with 0 console/page errors.
- Current classification: AW2E is `crop/state offset likely; large visual/style/default-state delta`; Les-Oublies is `crop does not explain most mismatch; medium delta`. These are triage hints, not parity claims.
- Next action: use the classification to inspect fixture default state/reference crop before changing rendering code.

## Reporting Guardrails

- Do not claim Roll20 visual parity yet.
- Do not claim all-sheet support yet.
- Do not collapse standalone preview evidence into live edit-mode evidence.
- Do not call auto-prefix real legacy sanitize.
- Do not edit protected external source corpus folders.
